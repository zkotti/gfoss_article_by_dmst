# Contribution at Open Source Software Projects from the students of Athens University of Economics and Business

###### *This is an article conducted from the students of the department of Business Science and Technology, Athens University of Economics and Business, for the self-titled assignment implemented within the course 'Applied Software Engineering' under the supervision of professor mr. Diomidis Spinellis*

### *Getting acquainted with the Department, the Course and the Assignment*
The Department of Management Science and Technology in the Athens University of Economics and Business aims to bridge the gap between Business Administration and Information Technology. The course "Software Engineering in Practice" belongs to the "Software and Data Analysis" major and is taught in the sixth semester of studies of the Department. During this course, we were asked to implement the assignment to which this article reffers.

This assignment included the selection of an open-source project on GitHub and the contribution to it. The ultimate goal of this contribution was to familiarize with the real conditions of open source software development and to learn new technologies. At the same time, we have been given the opportunity to be part of development groups beyond the Greek borders, within strictly defined rules and principles.

### *Project Selection*
Regarding the choice of the repository for our contribution, we had freedom of choice, without programming language or range of technologies limitations. In fact, we have been encouraged to experiment with new languages and tools that we have not worked with so far.

Throughout the project selection process, both the professor and the assistants guided us with presentations and tips in order to avoid projects that were too complex or too simple, inactive projects or projects not working with proper processes.

Despite the help, the majority of students are inexperienced in real software development conditions. Therefore, we did not know what to expect and we feared that we would eventually fail to meet the expectations of those responsible.

### *Contribution Process*
The preparation of the contribution initially included running the selected software, which proved to be far more difficult than we expected. Many projects used technologies that many were not familiar with. In order to understand these, we took refuge on the internet and the assistants of the course, Ms Antonios Gortzis and Tushar Sharma, whose help was valuable.

After the successful execution of the software, we had to design our contribution. We could either work on a software problem or create a new function that we thought could add value to it.

Moving to the "action", of course, it was necessary to understand the language, the environment and the structure of the program, as well as the established conventions among the members of the development team.

Completing the writing of our code, follows our first Pull Request. There was enthusiasm, as we managed to achieve the desired result, but also anxiety, as our code would be evaluated by the responsible development team, hoping to see the message "Merged", that is, accepting and integrating our contribution to the software.

In parallel with the contribution process, two interim presentations were conducted within the course, in order to guide and organize the process and time properly, as well as to inform the teacher about our progress.

### *Final Presentation*
The final result of each contribution was reflected in the final presentation. This included Design, Implementation, Testing, and the integration of each project. In less than five minutes, we presented our contribution, the problems that we had met and the ways to deal with them.

Notable repositories to which we contributed are  [Nodeschool](https://github.com/nodeschool/nodeschool.github.io), [Coördinator](https://github.com/spotify/coordinator), [Exercism](https://github.com/exercism/java), [Mozilla pdf.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js), [Teammates](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/), [Jarvis](https://github.com/sukeesh/Jarvis) and more.

In summary, we were able to program in languages such as **Kotlin**, **C #**, **Java**, **JavaScript** **PHP** and **Python**. We developed code on platforms and frames such as **Android**, **Qt**, **Linux** and **npm**, we performed the appropriate checks of our code with libraries like **pytest**, **JUnit**, **Unit.js**, **PHPUnit** and **Scrutinizer**, and we used technologies, interfaces and tools like **MongoDB**, **Travis CI**, **Gulp**, **Drag'n'Drop**, **JSON**, **SVG**, **CSS**, **VirtualEnv**, **Svelte**, **Google Docs API**.

Finally, the code of many of us has either already been adopted from the repositories or is already running productively while one of us was invited to officially join the development team.

### *Communication with the Software Development Team*
Effective communication with the development team was an important factor in the success of our contribution to the project. Communication was mainly through Issues in GitHub, Gitter and e-mail. It was also through the Pull Requests themselves, in which the development team proposed, through comments, improvements to the code we had already submitted.

In the majority of cases, cooperation with the implementation teams was good. Those responsible responded quickly, courteously and willing to help us. However, there have been confusions with the proposed changes or even lack of responsiveness and interest from project managers. In other cases, the contributors were invited to conduct a market investigation in order that their proposal could be accepted.

### *Value of the Contribution*
The importance of this assignment differs to a certain degree from person to person, depending on his/her interest in future occupational employment in this field. However, what we are all sure about is that we have won many important experiences for our subsequent steps.

Indicatively, we gained new knowledge in the fields of Code Reading, Language and Technology Understanding, Writing, Auditing, Testing and Formatting of the Code, Communication, and Time Management and Pressure Management.

Concluding, therefore, the process of contributing to open source software projects is far from simple. However, the feeling of satisfaction that one derives from the idea of ​​being merged in a repository deserves is worth the trouble.

Apart from the programming element, it is a great opportunity for collaboration and interaction with groups of people from every part of the earth. The knowledge, advice, criticism, rewards given to you by people unknown until yesterday can have a significant impact on your progression not only as a developer but also as a partner.
