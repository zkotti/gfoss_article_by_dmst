# Contribution at Open Source Software Projects from the students of Athens University of Economics and Business

###### *This is an article conducted from the students of the department of Business Science and Technology, Athens University of Economics and Business, for the self-titled assignment implemented within the course 'Applied Software Engineering' under the supervision of professor mr. Diomidis Spinellis*

### Introduction
The Department of Management Science and Technology in the Athens University of Economics and Business aims to bridge the gap between Business Administration and Information Technology. As students there  we have attended equivalent courses of Management, such as Marketing, Accounting, Human Resource Management, and Technology, such as Programming, Design and Development of Information Systems and Databases.

In the third year of our studies, we are asked to choose one of the following majors: Strategy and Human Resources, Operations Research and Business Analytics, Operations and Supply Chain Management, Software and Data Analysis or Information Systems and e-Business. In addition, we can take a number of courses from a second major and have it as a secondary one. The course "Software Engineering in Practice" belongs to the major of Software Technologies and Data Analysis and is taught in the 6th semester of our studies. In this context, we were invited to do the assignment to which this article refers.

The assignment we were meant to do referred to the choice of an open source project on GitHub and our contribution to it. In particular, every student had to contribute at least one hundred lines of code in order to play an important role in improving the selected project. We were able to choose a project based on our interests and without any restriction regarding the programming language and the general scope of the technologies used. The aim of the assignment was to get familiar with the real conditions of software development, as well as having the opportunity to work with the technology of our interests.  

### Unit 1
More precisely, in this assignment we had to study the code, structure and  issues of a project and find an existing issue or create a new one that we thought would solve a problem.
Our professor and the lab assistants guided us throughout the selection with presentations and suggestions, in order to avoid projects that were too complex or very simple, or projects that are no longer active or do not work with proper processes.
Despite the help, the majority of students were inexperienced in real working conditions, so we did not know what to expect and feared that we could not possibly do it, since the contribution to open-source software seemed very difficult.

### Contribution Process
At the beginning, we had to run the project that we had chosen, which was much more difficult than we had imagined. Each project uses different technologies, which most of us have not worked with in the past. This made our work harder and delayed us a lot. In order to overcome this kind of problems, we firstly resorted to the internet and those of us who continued to find obstacles turned to the assistants of the course, Mr Antonis Gkortzis and Mr Tushar Sharma, whose help proved to be valuable.

So after we were able to see the code running, we had to decide how we would contribute to this project. The choices were many. We could choose to fix some of the issues already identified. We could report a problem we found and then fix it. We could even suggest and develop some extra functionality or some feature that would widen the project.

After all this work, we were ready to start writing code. This requires an understanding of the implementation structure and acclimatizing of the contracts that have been made between the members of the project development team, which has proven to be a very important aspect of the process, as many of us have been faced with such problems. In addition, we had to get acquainted with the language and the environment where we would work.
