# Contribution to Open-Source Software Projects from Students of the Athens University of Economics and Business

###### *An article conducted by the students of the [Department of Management Science and Technology](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/dmst) (DMST) of the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB), for the self-titled assignment implemented in the context of the course "Software Engineering in Practice", under the supervision of professor [Mr. Diomidis Spinellis](https://www2.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/index.en.html).*

### *About the Department, Course and Assignment*
The Department of Management Science and Technology of the Athens University of Economics and Business aims to bridge the gap between Business Administration and Information Technology. The course "Software Engineering in Practice" belongs to the "Software and Data Analysis" stream and is taught in the sixth semester of studies of the Department. During this course, we were asked to implement this particular assignment the article refers to.

This assignment included the selection of an open-source project from [GitHub](https://github.com/) and the contribution to it. The ultimate goal of this contribution was to familiarize with the real conditions of open-source software development and to learn new technologies. At the same time, we were given the opportunity to be part of development groups beyond the Greek borders, following strictly defined rules and principles.

### *The Project Selection*
Regarding the selection of the repository for our contribution, we were free to choose whatever we desired, without any limitations to the programming language or technology range. In fact, we were encouraged to experiment with new languages and tools that we had not worked with before.

Throughout the project selection process, both the professor and the assistants guided us with presentations and tips, in order to avoid projects that were too complex or too simple, inactive projects or without appropriate processes.

Despite their help, the majority of students were inexperienced in real software development conditions. Therefore, we did not know what to expect, thus we feared the possibility of failing to meet the expectations of our instructors.

### *The Contribution Process*
The preparation of the contribution initially included executing the selected software, which proved to be far more difficult than we had expected. Many projects used technologies that a lot of us were not familiar with. In order to understand these technologies, we took refuge on the Internet and the assistants of the course, Mr. Antonios Gkortzis and Mr. Tushar Sharma, whose assistance was valuable.

After the successful execution of the software, it was time to design our contribution. We could either work on a problem of the software or create a new function which we believed would add value to it.

Moving on to the "action", it was necessary to understand the language, the environment and the structure of the program, as well as the conventions established among the members of the development team.

After completing the writing of our code, it was finally time for our first Pull Request. We were full of enthusiasm as we had managed to achieve the desired result, but at the same time we were also anxious since our code would be reviewed by the development team in charge; we hoped to see the message "Merged", that is, the acceptance and integration of our contribution to the software.

Along with the contribution process, two interim presentations were conducted in the context of the course, in order for us to be guided and evaluated regarding the process and time management, as well as for the professor to be informed about our progress.

### *The Final Presentation*
The final result of each contribution was depicted in the last presentation. This presentation included the Design, Implementation, Testing, and Integration of each project. In less than five minutes, we presented our contribution, the problems we faced and the ways we overcame them.

Notable repositories to which we contributed are [Nodeschool](https://github.com/nodeschool/nodeschool.github.io), [Co√∂rdinator](https://github.com/spotify/coordinator), [Exercism](https://github.com/exercism/java), [Mozilla pdf.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js), [Teammates](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/), [Jarvis](https://github.com/sukeesh/Jarvis) and many more.

In summary, we were able to program in languages such as **Kotlin**, **C#**, **Java**, **JavaScript**, **PHP** and **Python**. We developed code on platforms and frameworks such as **Android**, **Qt**, **Linux** and **npm**, we performed the appropriate testing of our code using libraries like **pytest**, **JUnit**, **Unit.js**, **PHPUnit** and **Scrutinizer**, and we used technologies, interfaces and tools like **MongoDB**, **Travis CI**, **Gulp**, **Drag'n'Drop**, **JSON**, **SVG**, **CSS**, **VirtualEnv**, **Svelte**, **Google Docs API**.

Finally, the code of a lot of us has either already been adopted from the repositories or is already running in production, while one of us was invited to officially join the development team of the project she contributed.

### *The Communication with the Software Development Team*
The effective communication with the development team was an important factor in the success of our contribution. The communication was mainly performed through Issues on GitHub, Gitter and e-mail. It was also managed through the Pull Requests where the development team suggested, through comments, improvements to the code that we had already submitted.

In the majority, the cooperation with the implementation teams was perfect. The developers in charge would respond quickly, courteously and willing to help us. Nevertheless, there were also confusions with some proposed changes or even lack of correspondence and interest from the project managers. In some cases, the contributors were instructed to conduct a market investigation, in order for their proposition to be accepted.

### *The Value of the Contribution*
The importance of this assignment varies from one to another to a certain degree, depending on his/her interest in future professional occupation in this field. However, if there is one thing we are all sure about is that we have earned many important stepping stones for our subsequent progression.

Indicatively, we gained new knowledge in the fields of Code Reading, Language and Technology Understanding, Code Writing, Auditing, Testing and Formatting, Communication, and Time and Pressure Management.

Taking everything into account, the process of contributing to open-source software projects is far from simple. However, the satisfaction one derives when seeing his idea being merged with the repository is worth all the adversities he encountered.

Apart from programming, it also offers a great opportunity for collaboration and interaction with groups of people from every continent of the Earth. The knowledge, advice, criticism and rewards you may earn from people unknown to you until yesterday can have a significant impact on your progression not only as a developer but also as a collaborator.
