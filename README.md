# Article for the GFOSS - Open Technologies Alliance
This repository was made for the composition of an article for the [GFOSS â€“ Open Technologies Alliance]( https://gfoss.eu/ ).

You can read the published article (in Greek) [here]( https://edu.ellak.gr/2018/06/21/sinisfora-fititon-tou-opa-se-erga-logismikou-anichtou-kodika/ ).

The article was composed by undergraduate students of the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB) from the Department of 
Management Science and Technology (DMST).

The project was developed in the context of the course "Software Engineering in Practice" under the supervision of our professor, [Mr. Diomidis Spinellis](https://github.com/dspinellis). The Open Technologies Alliance kindly asked
us to provide an article regarding our semester assignment "Contribution to an Open-Source Project". 

In this article we share our experience, thoughts, opinions and recommendations regarding the aforementioned assignment. 

The article is provided in both Greek and English.
